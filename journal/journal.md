# 1701QCA Final project journal: *Poppy Ritchie*

<!--- As for other assessments, fill out the following journal sections with information relevant to your project. --->

<!--- Markdown reference: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ --->

## Related projects ##
<!--- Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the appropriate folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing. --->

### Interactive cloud ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->
![Image](Interactivecloud)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Name of related project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQSZQZIuIk4)

<!--- Include information about why this project is related to yours. --->
This project is related to mine because at the beginning this was one of my biggest inspirations and i wanted to create something similar. I couldn’t copy a project that already exsits though so it just gave me an idea of what my design intent will be and the area that I’m interested in. I was going to include sound in my final project too but it is way out of my depth to create. It is a much larger project than what I’m creating but it still involves LED light which relates to my project.


<!--- Repeat code above for a total of 6 related projects --->

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

### Making compass ### https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/compass This page from Mircowas useful for my project as it help me wrap my head around the basics of compass coding which I have to include in my project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzK1AKUiGy0 I found this video useful in terms of the compass coding. The tutorial explains all the steps and makes it easy to follow.

### Connecting LED lights ### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2-yVXFMeE I watched many videos similar to this one to help myself learn more about LED circut. All the videos that i watched are similar but some more than others relate to my project more. Although in my final project I will probably use crocodile clips instead of the breadboard but these videos still help me get an idea of the technical side.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->
The design intent for this project is a night light sutible for a side table, the light will be interactive with a nice aesthetic look.

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->
### Design concept 1 ###
 Chair carousel 
I have 3 different concepts that all have a similar function. The first concept has a chair carousel look, it would small enough for a side table and the chairs would be replaced with 5 fairy lights. When you press the button at the base it will turn on the fairy lights and it will start rotating which makes the fairy lights attached fly out and around clockwise.

 Materials:
 - Mirco continous rotation servo 
 - Mircro bit 
 - 3x M/F jumper wires 
 - Fairy lights
 - String 
 - Wood/ wood pole

### Design concept 2 ###
Crater lamp
The crater lamp is also suitable for a side table that reflects a beautiful patterned light around the dark room. It allows preferred amount of light out through the holes. The lamp would be a acrylic cube with about 12 different sized holes arounf it, it would be a soild colour not allowing light out unless a cork block was removed from one of the holes.

 Materials:
 - Acrylic 
 - Cork blocks 
 - LED 
 - Mircobit

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
